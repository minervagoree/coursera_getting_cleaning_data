coursera_getting_cleaning_data
==============================

This repository has the information for the end of class project for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course and the course project.  Getting and Cleaning Data is the third class in a series of 9 classes in the specialization.  All the analysis is done in R programming.

* Deliverables for Project 1
  * The Samsung tidy data I created can be reconstructed by following the steps I will spell out in this ReadMe document.
  * In this repository you will find a run_analysis.R file where by running the code you will get a tidy data file of Samsung info
  * The last deliverable for this project is a codebook.  You can find a CodeBook.md markdown file where I list all the variables in the tidy list.
* Steps to run the run_analysis.R file. Note: It is assumed you already contain the data in your local directory.  If not you can get it at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
