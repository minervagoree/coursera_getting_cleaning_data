  * The Samsung tidy data I created can be reconstructed by following the steps I will spell out in this ReadMe document.
  * In this repository you will find a run_analysis.R file where by running the code you will get a tidy data file of Samsung info
  * The last deliverable for this project is a codebook.  You can find a CodeBook.md markdown file where I list all the variables in the tidy list.
* Steps to run the run_analysis.R file.
